# df-informer
There is a good library for dataset analisys - **pandas_profiling**. 

But if it's too nice, you could use this simple script to get your dataframe analysed.  

Command line tool requires: ```'--input', '-i'``` (Path to file(.csv) to be processed)  
Other options:              ```'--header', '-1'``` (Replace header with first row? "None" to leave as is)  
                            ```'--output', '-o'```, by default="output.html" (Path to file name with extension to store result in md, html or xlsx)
